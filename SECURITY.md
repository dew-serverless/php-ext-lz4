# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, please use the GitHub
Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/dew-serverless/php-ext-lz4/security/advisories/new)

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make
every effort to acknowledge your contributions. Please do not publicly disclose
the vulnerability until it's been fixed. This ensures that users of the project
are not exposed to potential threats.
